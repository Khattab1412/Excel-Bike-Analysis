# Bike Buyers Analysis Project

This project analyzes a dataset of bike buyers, providing insights through data manipulation, pivot tables, and visualizations. The analysis focuses on various demographic factors and their relationship to bike purchasing behavior.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `ID`: Unique identifier for each individual
- `Marital Status`: Marital status of the individual (Married or Single)
- `Gender`: Gender of the individual
- `Income`: Annual income of the individual
- `Children`: Number of children
- `Education`: Education level of the individual
- `Occupation`: Occupation of the individual
- `Home Owner`: Home ownership status
- `Cars`: Number of cars owned
- `Commute Distance`: Commute distance to work
- `Region`: Geographic region of the individual
- `Age`: Age of the individual
- `Purchased Bike`: Whether the individual purchased a bike (Yes or No)

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several sheets within the Excel file:

1. **bike_buyers**: Contains the raw dataset with all demographic details and bike purchasing status.
2. **Working Sheet**: Includes data preprocessing steps such as correcting marital status, gender, and age brackets.
3. **Pivot Table**: Provides summary statistics and insights derived from the raw data, including counts and averages of various demographic factors.
4. **Visualization**: Contains charts and graphs visualizing the data insights and pivot table results.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Demographic Insights**: The analysis examines how marital status, gender, income, education, occupation, home ownership, number of cars, commute distance, and region correlate with bike purchasing behavior.
- **Age Brackets**: The dataset segments individuals into age brackets (e.g., Middle Aged, Old, Young) to observe bike purchasing trends across different age groups.
- **Pivot Tables**: Summary statistics, such as the count of bike purchases and average income by demographic categories, are generated to provide a comprehensive overview of the data.

## Visualizations

The `Visualization` sheet includes various charts that illustrate key findings from the analysis, such as:
- Distribution of bike purchases by age bracket
- Average income of bike purchasers versus non-purchasers
- Breakdown of bike purchases by gender and region
